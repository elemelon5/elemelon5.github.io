Thank you for visiting my blog.

My name is Arogya Koirala, and in this blog I talk about the intersection of technology, media and policy in the context of the small Himalayan country of Nepal.

I will be aiming to post at least a couple of articles every month that cover the following concepts (in no particular order):

    The role that effective data visualization, and interactive content can play in investigative journalism of today,
    The emerging need for journalists of today to expand their competencies to serve these needs,
    The state of technology policy in Nepal, and current efforts to improve the same,
    The state of the open data initiative that is currently under way in Nepal

If you find any of my work helpful, and would like to use it or collaborate in any way, feel free to reach out to me at arogyakoirala@gmail.com
